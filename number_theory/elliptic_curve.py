#  Elliptic curves are useful because of something called point addition.
#  Point addition is where we can do an operation on two of the points on the curve and get a third point, also on the curve.
#  It turns out that for every elliptic curve, a line will intersect it at either one point or three points, except in a couple of special cases it intersect at two points.
#  The two exceptions are when a line is exactly vertical and when a line is tangent to the curve.

#  The class represents a points in an Elliptic Curve
